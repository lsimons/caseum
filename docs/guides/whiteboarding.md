# Whiteboarding guide

**It helps to be serious about whiteboarding. Prepare your whiteboarding sessions, practice your skills.**

## Preparing for whiteboarding

Like any activity whiteboarding sessions go better when you prepare for them well. So, prepare!

### Plan to capture your whiteboard outputs

Reserve time at the end of a whiteboarding session to immediately capture all of the content you produced in a permanent form and [record it](records.md). Taking photos with your cell phone and uploading them works well.

There are great free mobile apps that help process whiteboard pictures. Try Microsoft Lens ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/office-lens/id975925059)) or Adobe Scan ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-pdf-ocr-scanner/id1199564834)). Try Post-It ([Android](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/post-it/id920127738), [iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmm.postit)) if you have a whiteboard full of post-it notes. Have such apps on your phone before the session.

There are also great mobile apps for keeping digital records. If you use Slack, have the slack app on your phone. If you use SharePoint, have the onedrive app on your phone. Log into the apps beforehand and try uploading some pictures with them.

### Have lots of materials

* It is great to have lots of whiteboards (7 is a good number). Even better is a room where all the walls are whiteboards. On a budget you can get whiteboard stickers to put on walls or windows.
* Have enough markers in multiple colors (black, blue, green, red).
* Have dry-wipe cloth plus whiteboard cleaning spray to clean the whiteboards. Cheap cloths often work better than whiteboard eraser blocks.
* Have enough decent quality sticky notes. The adhesive on old or cheap sticky notes gets worse and then the notes may come down off the board. Have multiple colors (for event storming, orange, purple, blue, green).

## Practicing whiteboarding

Drawing is a skill you get better at through practice. So, practice!

### Get comfortable with writing on whiteboards

Practice your writing on a whiteboard:
* Try to write more slowly, drawing nice letters instead of scribbling ugly ones.
* Try to write in a straight line.
* Try to write vertically.
* Try to write larger and smaller letters.
* Try to estimate how many letters you can fit in an area. Draw smaller and bigger boxes and try to write certain words in them.

Evaluate your own writing by looking at the board at a distance. Then wipe it out and do better. If there are certain letters you can't write well, practice just those letters.

Your handwriting does not need to be pretty but it should be readable.

### Get comfortable with drawing on whiteboards

Practice simple drawing on a whiteboard:
* draw lots of rectangles of different sizes.
* draw lots of squares of different sizes.
* draw lots of straight lines of every angle.
* draw lots of ovals and circles.
* draw simple symbols for people.

You can find a lot of specific drawing exercies online, but you don't need to learn creative drawing. Just do a lot of drawing and actively try to do a good job at it and you will improve.

### Draw to take photos

Practices whiteboarding to capture the result:
* make a simple diagram on a whiteboard with boxes, lines and text
* take a photo of the diagram with your phone
* look at the photo
* see what does and does not look good in the photo, pick one thing to improve
* wipe the drawing and try to make the same drawing again
* take another photo and see if the result is better
* rinse, repeat

When you plan to take a photo of a whiteboard later you will often make a nicer drawing.

### Draw with colors

Practice whiteboarding with colors:
* study the Caseum color scheme and try to make drawings on the whiteboard in the same or a similar color scheme
* practice keeping multiple markers in your hands and switching between them as you draw

Once you are used to drawing with multiple colors it will help make the output of your brainstorming sessions look better.

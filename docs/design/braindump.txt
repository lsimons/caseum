What?

    Modern approach to (web / enterprise) architecture that's similar to C4 in complexity while being more oriented toward different kinds of models.

Kinds of models?

    people
        users & administrators
        actors
        personas

    events
        event storming
        event driven architecture
        CQRS
        processes
        messages

    facts
        fact based modeling
        information modeling
            data
            syntax
            semantics
            information

        designing
        presenting
        implementing
        documenting

    friendly vs factual
    different usage in different interactions
        sales/customer
        developer/operator
        developer/product manager
        architect/developer
        analist/developer
        developer/developer
        developer
    color
        accessible
            color blind friendly
            high contrast
        bright & bold
        C4 (blue...) compatible
        print and screen compatible
        optional
